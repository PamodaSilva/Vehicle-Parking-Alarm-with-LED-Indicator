# Vehicle-Parking-Alarm-with-LED-Indicator - IOT_Project

This project discusses about parking warning sensors in a public parking or home garage. It helps to avoid the obstacles in a public parking and park the vehicles in the slots properly. This is also very helpful for an inexperienced driver when parking his vehicle. 
Thus, the damage to the vehicle can be minimized even when the rear-view mirror is not visible while stopping. It is more advantageous to install this sensor in the garage of your home. In this project, the ultrasonic sensor can detect the vehicle and the distance to the obstacles can be detected by the colors shown by the LED indicator, and if the vehicle is too close to the obstacle, the buzzer will sound.
